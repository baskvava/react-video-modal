# Fixed Width

If want to have fixed the video modal, there are two props to set up it for your video modal

## Props

```jsx
width: number; // default is undefined
responsive: boolean; // default is false
```

## Fixed Width

Only set up fixed width without responsive. When change the widow size will not change the video modal width.

> How to do if I also want it with responsive? Don't worried about it! Let's jump to next example: [Responsive](#responsive)

### Usage

<FixedWidth />

<CodeBlock
  language="jsx"
  title="/src/components/FixedWidth/FixedWidth.jsx"
  >
  {rawFiexdWidth}

</CodeBlock>

## Responsive

Set up a fixed width video modal that is still responsive

> Note: The Responsive feature used with fixed width only supports for the widow size smaller than fixed width setting. If the window size larger than fixed width setting, only display fixed width size

Try to change widow size to test the feature when open your modal

### Usage

<Responsive />

<CodeBlock
  language="jsx"
  title="/src/components/FixedWidth/Responsive.jsx"
  >
  {rawResponsive}

</CodeBlock>
```
